# Line-Follower-Robot

<h3>Description</h3>
<div>This is a microcontroller-based machine that can detect and follow the line drawn on the floor, and can avoid obstacles to reach the destination. Here, I used C++ programming language for develop control program, Ultrasonic sensor for detect obstacle, use IR sensor for detect the line on floor. I used Arduino microcontroller module for this car.
